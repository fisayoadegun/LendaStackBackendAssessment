## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Clean Architecture:** Layered architecture ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and scalability.
- **Security Middleware:** Middleware-based token validation and authorization to secure endpoints.
- **Global Exception Handler:** Centralized error handling with consistent error responses for improved developer experience.
- **EF Core + SQL Server:** Uses Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for reliable data access and storage.
- **FluentValidation:** Applies strong validation rules on all request models using FluentValidation.
- **MediatR:** Leverages MediatR for CQRS implementation and decoupled command/query logic.
- **AutoMapper:** Simplifies DTO-to-entity conversions and vice versa.
- **Serilog Logging:** Structured and file-based logging using Serilog for tracking application behavior and diagnostics.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Comprehensive test suite using xUnit to ensure correctness and reliability.
- **Performance Middleware:** Tracks execution time of requests and flags long-running operations.
- **Data Seeding:** Pre-populated dummy data for test and demo purposes.
